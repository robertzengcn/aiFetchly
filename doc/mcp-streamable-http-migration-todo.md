# MCP Server Migration: SSE to Streamable HTTP

## Overview
This document outlines the complete migration plan from Server-Sent Events (SSE) to Streamable HTTP for the AiFetchly MCP Server. Streamable HTTP provides better performance, simpler client implementation, and more reliable connection handling compared to SSE.

## Current Architecture Analysis
- **Current Transport**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) with HTTP POST for requests
- **Current Files**: `HttpServerWrapper.ts`, `AiFetchlyMCPServer.ts`, `SSEServerConfig.ts`
- **Current Issues**: Complex session management, connection timeouts, CORS complications

## Migration Goals
- Replace SSE transport with Streamable HTTP
- Simplify connection management
- Improve performance and reliability
- Maintain MCP protocol compatibility
- Support both streaming and non-streaming responses
