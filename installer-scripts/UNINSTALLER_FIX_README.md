# Uninstaller Fix - Installation Directory Issue

## Problem
The uninstaller (`uninstall.exe`) was not being copied to the installation directory after the application was installed, making it difficult for users to uninstall the application.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **WiX Custom Action Issues**: The custom action script wasn't properly integrated with the WiX installer
2. **Missing File References**: The uninstaller wasn't being properly included in the installer package
3. **Build Process Gaps**: The uninstaller wasn't being copied to the project root for easy access during packaging

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Forge Configuration (`forge.config.js`)
- **Squirrel Installer**: Added `extraFiles` and `postInstallScript` to include and copy the uninstaller
- **WiX Installer**: Simplified configuration (WiX doesn't support extraFiles directly)
- **Post-Package Hook**: Added hook to copy uninstaller after packaging for all installers

### 2. Enhanced Copy Scripts
- **`copy-uninstaller.js`**: Improved to search multiple locations for the uninstaller source
- **`post-install-hook.js`**: New post-installation hook that works with all installer types
- **Better Error Handling**: All scripts now provide detailed logging and verification

### 3. Updated Build Process (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
- **Uninstaller Build**: Enhanced to copy uninstaller to project root for easier access
- **Verification Steps**: Added checks to ensure uninstaller is present in multiple locations
- **Better Logging**: More detailed output to help debug issues

### 4. Testing Tools
- **`test-uninstaller-setup.js`**: New script to verify all uninstaller files are present and working
- **Comprehensive Checks**: Tests file existence, copy functionality, and script execution

## How to Test

### 1. Run the Test Script
```bash
cd installer-scripts
node test-uninstaller-setup.js
```

### 2. Build and Test Locally
```bash
# Build the uninstaller
cd installer-scripts
yarn add pkg
npx pkg standalone-uninstaller.js --targets node18-win-x64 --output uninstall.exe

# Copy to project root
cp uninstall.exe ../uninstall.exe

# Build the application
yarn make-win:test
```

### 3. Verify Installation
After installing the application:
1. Navigate to the installation directory (usually `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aiFetchly`)
2. Check if `uninstall.exe` is present
3. Run `uninstall.exe` to test the uninstall process

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Uninstaller should be present in the installation directory
- ✅ Uninstaller should be executable and functional
- ✅ Uninstaller should remove all application files and registry entries
- ✅ Uninstaller should remove shortcuts and user data

## Troubleshooting

### If uninstaller is still missing:
1. Check the build logs for any errors during uninstaller creation
2. Verify that `uninstall.exe` exists in the project root before building
3. Check that the custom action scripts are being executed during installation
4. Run the test script to identify which components are missing

### If uninstaller doesn't work:
1. Check Windows Event Viewer for any errors
2. Verify that the uninstaller has proper permissions
3. Test running the uninstaller as Administrator
4. Check that all required dependencies are included

## Files Modified
- `forge.config.js` - Updated installer configurations and added post-package hook
- `installer-scripts/copy-uninstaller.js` - Enhanced copy functionality
- `installer-scripts/post-install-hook.js` - New post-installation hook
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Improved build process
- `installer-scripts/test-uninstaller-setup.js` - New testing tool

## Next Steps
1. Test the changes in a development environment
2. Build and test the installer locally
3. Deploy to test environment and verify uninstaller functionality
4. Monitor user feedback after deployment
