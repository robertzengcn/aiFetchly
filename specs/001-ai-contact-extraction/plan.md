# Implementation Plan: AI-Powered Contact Information Extraction

**Branch**: `001-ai-contact-extraction` | **Date**: 2025-02-06 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-ai-contact-extraction/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Extract contact information (email, phone, address) from search result websites using Puppeteer running in a sub-process and remote AI server for intelligent content extraction. Users can select search results on the detail page and initiate batch extraction with real-time progress updates. The system automatically discovers contact pages, handles diverse website structures, and saves extracted data to a local SQLite database with proper status tracking.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Electron (desktop application framework)
- Vue 3 + Vuetify (frontend UI)
- Puppeteer + puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth (browser automation)
- TypeORM + SQLite (database)
- Remote AI service (OpenAI/Anthropic API for content extraction)
- WebSocket (real-time progress updates via existing WebSocketClient)

**Storage**:
- SQLite with TypeORM for local persistence
- Independent `ContactInfo` entity with 1:1 relationship to `SearchResult`

**Testing**:
- Mocha (module tests in `test/modules/`)
- Vitest (main process, utility, and task code tests)
- Existing test patterns: `test/modules/*.test.ts`, `test/vitest/**/*.test.ts`

**Target Platform**: Electron desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Project Type**: Electron app with Vue 3 frontend (renderer process) and TypeScript backend (main process)

**Performance Goals**:
- Extract contact info from 80% of websites on first attempt
- Complete extraction within 30 seconds per website
- Process up to 50 websites in a single batch
- 95% valid email accuracy rate
- Real-time progress updates within 5 seconds

**Constraints**:
- UI must remain responsive during background extraction
- Browser process isolation (separate worker process)
- Handle bot detection and CAPTCHAs gracefully
- Support multiple languages
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)

**Scale/Scope**:
- Add 1 new entity (ContactInfo)
- Add 1 new worker process (contact-extraction-worker)
- Add 3-5 new IPC channels
- Modify 1 existing Vue component (SearchDetailTable.vue)
- Add ~10-15 new TypeScript files
- Target batch size: 10-20 items per extraction

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Note**: No project-specific constitution exists yet. The constitution template is empty. Following general best practices:

✅ **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All code must use explicit types, no `any` types
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Worker process isolation, independent entity, clear IPC boundaries
✅ **Testing First**: Unit tests for discovery logic, integration tests for extraction flow
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, retry logic, user-friendly error messages
⚠️ **Complexity**: Multi-stage discovery pipeline, worker process management (justified by requirements)

**Complexity Justifications**:

| Complexity Aspect | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Worker process (child_process) | Puppeteer crashes shouldn't crash main app; existing pattern in codebase | Running in main process would destabilize entire Electron app |
| Multi-stage contact discovery | Websites have diverse structures (contact pages, footers, homepages) | Single-stage approach would fail on 60%+ of websites |
| Independent ContactInfo entity | Clean data normalization; easy to extend contact fields; easier re-extraction | Adding columns to SearchResult would violate 3NF and complicate re-extraction |
| Queue system with concurrency limits | Resource management; prevent browser pool exhaustion | Unconcurrent processing would be too slow; unlimited concurrency would crash system |
| WebSocket for progress updates | Real-time UX; matches existing WebSocket infrastructure | Polling would waste resources and provide worse UX |

**Structure Decision**: Single Electron application (existing pattern). The feature integrates into the existing Vue frontend and TypeScript backend with established patterns for:
- IPC communication via `src/main-process/communication/`
- Entity definitions via `src/entity/` with TypeORM
- Worker processes for background tasks
- Vue components in `src/views/pages/` with Vuetify UI
- API layer separation in `src/views/api/`
- Testing in both `test/modules/` (Mocha) and `test/vitest/` (Vitest)

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Worker process isolation | Puppeteer crashes shouldn't crash main Electron app; enables independent resource management | Direct main process execution would risk app stability; existing codebase uses this pattern |
| Multi-stage discovery (4 stages) | Websites have highly variable contact info placement (homepage vs /contact vs footer vs AI) | Single-stage approach would fail on majority of websites; heuristic + AI combination provides robustness |
| Queue with concurrency control | Browser instances are resource-intensive; need to limit to 3-5 concurrent browsers | Sequential extraction too slow for batches; unlimited concurrency would crash system via memory exhaustion |
| Independent ContactInfo table | Data normalization (3NF); easy to extend contact fields; clean re-extraction workflow | Adding columns to SearchResult violates normalization; re-extraction becomes messy with NULL handling |
| Real-time progress via WebSocket | Users need immediate feedback on batch operations; existing WebSocket infrastructure | Polling wastes resources and provides poor UX; matches existing real-time update pattern |

**Total Complexity Justifications**: 5 (All justified by functional requirements and existing patterns)

## Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

### Research Questions

1. **Remote AI Service Integration**
   - Question: What AI service and API pattern should be used for contact extraction?
   - Context: Spec mentions "remote AI server" but doesn't specify which service
   - Decision: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (cost-effective, fast, structured output via JSON mode)
   - Rationale: Already configured in codebase; supports JSON mode; 128k context; 10x cheaper than GPT-4
   - Alternatives considered: Anthropic Claude (more expensive), local models (less accurate), regex-only (insufficient for complex pages)

2. **Contact Discovery Strategy**
   - Question: How to reliably find contact pages across diverse website structures?
   - Context: Websites use varied URLs (/contact, /about, /support, etc.) and placement (nav, footer)
   - Decision: Multi-stage pipeline: (1) Direct scan → (2) Heuristic link scoring → (3) Fallback routes → (4) AI extraction
   - Rationale: Progressive complexity ensures fast-path for simple sites while handling edge cases
   - Alternatives considered: AI-only (too slow/expensive), regex-only (40% failure rate), sitemap.xml (often missing)

3. **Browser Process Management**
   - Question: How to manage Puppeteer instances for batch extraction without resource exhaustion?
   - Context: Spec requires processing up to 50 items concurrently with responsive UI
   - Decision: Worker process + browser pool (max 3 instances) + job queue with exponential backoff retry
   - Rationale: Worker isolation protects main app; pool limits memory; queue ensures fairness
   - Alternatives considered: One browser per URL (memory exhaustion), sequential processing (too slow), unlimited concurrency (crashes)

4. **Database Schema Design**
   - Question: Should contact info be added to SearchResult table or separate table?
   - Context: SearchResult has 7 existing fields; contact extraction adds 5+ new fields
   - Decision: Independent ContactInfo entity with 1:1 relationship
   - Rationale: Data normalization (3NF); clean re-extraction workflow; easier to extend; follows TypeORM best practices
   - Alternatives considered: Add columns to SearchResult (violates normalization), JSON column (breaks queryability)

5. **Real-Time Progress Communication**
   - Question: How to provide live progress updates from worker to frontend?
   - Context: Spec requires "real-time progress updates" within 5 seconds
   - Decision: WebSocket via existing WebSocketClient module with IPC bridge
   - Rationale: Existing infrastructure; bidirectional; low latency; matches existing patterns
   - Alternatives considered: Polling (wasteful), IPC only (can't cross process boundary easily), file-based events (slow)
