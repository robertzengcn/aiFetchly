# Task ID: 10
# Title: Finalize Security, Performance, and Compliance Measures
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Finalize the implementation by adding rate limiting, comprehensive logging, and ensuring compliance with web scraping ethics and email marketing regulations.
# Details:
Implement respectful rate limiting for all scraping platforms. Add audit logging for all MCP tool calls to a new `MCPRequestLog` table. Review all scraping logic to ensure it respects `robots.txt` and uses appropriate user agents. Ensure email tools include required compliance features like unsubscribe links.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct load testing to ensure the server meets the sub-500ms response time and 50+ concurrent connections target. Perform a security review of the code. Verify that firing rapid requests to a tool triggers a rate-limiting error.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Rate Limiting for MCP Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add rate limiting to all MCP tools to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across all scraping platforms.
### Details:
Implement rate limiting middleware that tracks requests per user/IP and enforces limits (e.g., 100 requests per minute per user). Use Redis or in-memory store for tracking. Apply different limits for different tool types based on their resource intensity.

## 2. Add Comprehensive Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement audit logging for all MCP tool calls to track usage, errors, and security events.
### Details:
Create MCPRequestLog table and logging system that records all tool calls with timestamps, user info, parameters (sanitized), responses, and performance metrics. Include security events like failed authentication attempts.

## 3. Implement Web Scraping Ethics Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all scraping logic respects robots.txt, uses appropriate user agents, and follows ethical scraping practices.
### Details:
Review and update all scraping controllers to check robots.txt before scraping, use respectful user agents, implement proper delays between requests, and respect rate limits set by target websites.

## 4. Add Email Marketing Compliance Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure email marketing tools include required compliance features like unsubscribe links and opt-out mechanisms.
### Details:
Update email marketing tools to include unsubscribe links, opt-out mechanisms, and compliance with CAN-SPAM Act and GDPR requirements. Add validation for required compliance fields.

## 5. Performance Optimization and Load Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize server performance and conduct load testing to ensure sub-500ms response times and 50+ concurrent connections.
### Details:
Review and optimize database queries, implement caching where appropriate, optimize response formatting, and conduct comprehensive load testing to verify performance targets are met.
