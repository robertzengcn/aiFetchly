		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Document Ingestion and Chunking",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Document Ingestion and Chunking'. Create subtasks for: 1. Setting up the metadata database schema (SQLite/IndexedDB) and access layer. 2. Implementing a modular parsing service for different document types (PDF, HTML, TXT, MD). 3. Developing the recursive character splitting chunking algorithm. 4. Building the main `addDocument` API endpoint that orchestrates the parsing, chunking, and metadata storage process.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves handling multiple distinct file formats, each with its own parsing library, implementing a custom chunking algorithm, and integrating with a database. Each of these components is a significant piece of work, making the overall task moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Multiple Embedding Model Providers",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Integrate Multiple Embedding Model Providers'. Create subtasks for implementing a wrapper for each provider: 1. OpenAI API client. 2. HuggingFace `transformers.js` local embedding generator. 3. Ollama local API client. Also, create subtasks for 4. Designing and implementing the `ModelRegistry` and a unified embedding service interface. 5. Building the `listModels` and `switchModel` management APIs.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity comes from integrating three distinct services (a remote API, a local library with heavy dependencies, and a local HTTP server). Each integration has unique challenges, and creating a unified abstraction layer on top adds significant architectural work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up FAISS Vector Store with faiss-node",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Set Up FAISS Vector Store with faiss-node'. Create subtasks for: 1. Setting up the project environment with `faiss-node` and its native dependencies. 2. Designing and implementing the `VectorStoreManager` class to handle multiple indexes. 3. Implementing the logic to create a new FAISS index and add vectors to it. 4. Implementing the methods for saving an index to disk and loading it back into memory.",
			"reasoning": "The primary complexity lies in correctly installing and using the `faiss-node` library, which has native dependencies. Building a robust manager class to handle multiple indexes, including their creation, loading, and saving, requires careful design to avoid data corruption or loss."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Embedding and Indexing Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Embedding and Indexing Pipeline'. Create subtasks to: 1. Extend the `addDocument` service to call the embedding service after chunking is complete. 2. Implement batching logic for sending chunks to the embedding model efficiently. 3. Integrate the `VectorStoreManager` to add the resulting vectors to the appropriate FAISS index. 4. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for the entire ingestion-to-indexing workflow.",
			"reasoning": "This is a crucial integration task that connects three major, independent components (parsing, embedding, storing). The complexity lies in orchestrating the data flow, managing state (e.g., which model is active), and handling errors gracefully across the entire pipeline to prevent inconsistent states."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Vector Search and Retrieval Logic",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop Vector Search and Retrieval Logic'. Create subtasks for: 1. Implementing the `search` API endpoint. 2. Integrating the embedding service to vectorize the incoming query. 3. Using the `VectorStoreManager` to perform a similarity search on the FAISS index. 4. Retrieving the full chunk content and metadata from the database based on search results. 5. Implementing the optional metadata filtering logic.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves coordinating multiple services in real-time: embedding the query, searching the vector index, and then fetching data from a separate metadata store. The implementation of efficient metadata filtering adds a layer of complexity to the retrieval logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Build the RAG Query Engine for Answer Generation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Build the RAG Query Engine for Answer Generation'. Create subtasks for: 1. Designing and testing the prompt template that instructs the LLM to answer based on provided context. 2. Implementing the main `generateAnswer` service function that orchestrates the process. 3. Integrating with the Ollama client to call the LLM with the constructed prompt. 4. Implementing the response streaming mechanism from the backend, likely using Server-Sent Events (SSE).",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is in two main areas: effective prompt engineering to ensure the LLM is grounded and avoids hallucination, and the technical implementation of response streaming from the backend to the frontend, which requires careful handling of asynchronous data flow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Frontend UI for Document Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop Frontend UI for Document Management'. Create Vue/Vuetify component subtasks for: 1. A drag-and-drop file upload zone. 2. A document list view that fetches and displays all ingested documents. 3. A modal or inline form for viewing and editing document metadata, including tags. 4. Implementing the API calls and state management for deleting documents. 5. Creating the overall page layout that combines these components.",
			"reasoning": "This is a moderately complex frontend task. It involves building multiple interactive components (drag-and-drop, list view, tagging interface) and managing the state and communication with the backend API for a full CRUD experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Create Chat and Search Interface with Streaming Markdown",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Create Chat and Search Interface with Streaming Markdown'. Create subtasks for: 1. Building the main chat UI layout with Vue/Vuetify. 2. Implementing the client-side logic to consume a streaming API response (e.g., using EventSource). 3. Integrating a markdown library to render the incoming text stream in real-time. 4. Developing the UI component to display source document chunks. 5. Implementing the model selection dropdown and wiring it to the backend API calls.",
			"reasoning": "The high complexity comes from the real-time, asynchronous nature of the task. Handling streaming data on the client, parsing it, and rendering it progressively as formatted markdown while managing the overall chat state is significantly more complex than a standard request-response UI."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 30,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Privacy Features and Finalize Application",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Privacy Features and Finalize Application'. Create subtasks for: 1. Implementing an encryption/decryption wrapper for file system operations using a user-provided password. 2. Integrating this wrapper to encrypt/decrypt FAISS index files. 3. Integrating encryption for the SQLite database (e.g., using SQLCipher). 4. Building the UI settings panel for enabling encryption. 5. Conducting a thorough review to confirm offline capabilities. 6. Configuring the Electron builder to package the application.",
			"reasoning": "The task's high complexity is driven by the security-critical nature of implementing encryption correctly. This involves key derivation, file I/O interception, and secure password handling. Additionally, it includes two other significant efforts: a full application audit and the final application packaging process."
