		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Core Infrastructure and Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks effectively cover defining models, implementing the schema, and creating module stubs. To enhance this, consider adding a dedicated subtask for 'Setup Project Configuration and Environment Variables' to manage database paths and other settings cleanly from the start. Also, ensure the 'Integrate and Test' subtask explicitly mentions testing the database connection and migration rollback.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task that is crucial but not algorithmically complex. The complexity lies in correctly setting up configurations, database migrations, and module structures. The 5 existing subtasks provide a solid, logical breakdown of these setup activities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Core Interfaces and Design Patterns",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks are well-structured. To improve, consider combining 'Define Core Data Model Interfaces' and 'Define Scraping Mechanism Interfaces' into a single 'Define Core Scraping and Data Interfaces' subtask. Then, add a new subtask: 'Document Interface Design Decisions and Usage Patterns' in the project's architectural documentation to ensure future developers understand the contracts.",
			"reasoning": "This is a low-effort, high-impact architectural task. The complexity is conceptual (designing good contracts) rather than executional. The work itself is primarily defining TypeScript interfaces, which is straightforward. The existing subtasks correctly break down the different interface categories."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Multi-Process Architecture and IPC",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks provide a solid foundation for the IPC implementation. To make it more robust, add a subtask for 'Implement a Timeout Mechanism for IPC Responses' to prevent the main process from hanging if a child process becomes unresponsive. Also, expand the 'Define IPC Protocol' subtask to include versioning for future compatibility.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it involves managing concurrent processes, asynchronous communication, and data serialization. Debugging and ensuring robustness in a multi-process architecture is a significant engineering challenge. The 5 subtasks correctly outline a step-by-step implementation plan."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build the Platform Extensibility Framework",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current breakdown is excellent. To further improve, add a subtask: 'Implement a Hot-Reload Mechanism for Platform Configurations'. This would allow the `PlatformRegistry` to watch the configuration directory for changes and update in real-time without an application restart, which is valuable for development and maintenance.",
			"reasoning": "The task is moderately complex. While the core registry pattern is simple, the implementation requires robust handling of file I/O, JSON parsing, and schema validation to be resilient against malformed configuration files. The subtasks correctly isolate these concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop First Platform Adapter (yellowpages.com)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks outline a perfect workflow. To enhance this, add a subtask for 'Analyze and Document Anti-Scraping Measures on yellowpages.com'. This proactive step involves checking for CAPTCHAs, dynamic content loading, and IP-based blocking, which will inform the implementation of the core scraping engine and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity of this task comes from the investigative work of analyzing a third-party website and the inherent brittleness of web scraping. The code itself follows a pattern, but finding the correct selectors and handling site-specific quirks requires significant effort. The subtasks model a standard, effective scraper development workflow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate with Existing Scheduler and Cookie Modules",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The subtasks correctly cover the implementation of the wrappers and their integration. To improve, add a subtask: 'Create Mock Implementations of Existing Modules for Isolated Testing'. This will allow the new wrapper modules to be tested thoroughly without a dependency on the actual `BackgroundScheduler` and `AccountCookiesModule`, improving test speed and reliability.",
			"reasoning": "This is a classic integration task using the adapter pattern. The complexity is low-to-moderate, as it primarily involves writing 'glue code' to connect to existing, presumably well-defined, modules. The main challenge is ensuring the translation between the systems is correct."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Scraping Engine",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks cover the core engine logic well. To make it more robust, add a subtask for 'Implement State Management within the Scraper Engine'. This would involve creating a simple state machine (e.g., INITIALIZING, SCRAPING, STOPPING) to make the engine's behavior more predictable and easier to debug, especially when handling `STOP` commands.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex piece of the application, orchestrating browser automation (Puppeteer), the adapter pattern, and inter-process communication within the child process. Managing the asynchronous lifecycle, state, and potential failure points of the scraping process is a significant challenge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop User Interface for Task and Platform Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The subtasks effectively break down the UI by feature. To improve user experience, add a new subtask: 'Implement Real-time UI Updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events'. This would push task progress changes from the server to the UI automatically, rather than relying on polling, providing a much more responsive feel.",
			"reasoning": "Modern UI development is moderately to highly complex, involving component-based architecture, client-side state management, asynchronous API communication, and ensuring a reactive user experience. The subtasks correctly break down the work into logical, feature-based components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Additional Platform Adapters",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks correctly assign one subtask per platform. To improve efficiency, create a new initial subtask: 'Create a Scaffolding Script to Generate Boilerplate for New Adapters'. This script would generate the adapter class file, the configuration JSON, and a basic test file, significantly speeding up the repetitive setup for each new platform.",
			"reasoning": "While the total volume of work is high, the task is highly repetitive and follows a pre-established pattern from Task 5. The complexity is therefore moderate, stemming from the investigative work required for each new site rather than solving new engineering problems. The subtasks correctly parallelize the work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Robust Error Handling, Reliability, and Rate Limiting",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The subtasks provide a comprehensive plan for reliability. To enhance this, add a subtask: 'Implement a Global Unhandled Exception and Unhandled Rejection Catcher'. This would be a final safety net in both the main and child processes to log any unexpected errors that bypass the explicit try-catch blocks, preventing silent failures.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex because it involves implementing cross-cutting concerns that affect the entire system's stability. Correctly implementing patterns like exponential backoff and propagating errors across process boundaries without introducing new bugs requires careful design and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Core Architecture and Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks effectively cover the setup of the Electron process model and the database schema. No further expansion is needed. The focus should be on ensuring robust process isolation and idempotent database migrations as outlined.",
			"reasoning": "The task combines two critical and complex areas: the multi-process architecture and database setup. These are foundational, and mistakes are costly. The complexity is high due to the architectural nature of the work. The 5 existing subtasks provide a good breakdown of the required steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Define Core System Interfaces and Factories",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current 5 subtasks provide a comprehensive plan for defining, mocking, and documenting the core interfaces. No further expansion is necessary. The key is to ensure the final peer review (subtask 5) is thorough, as these interfaces are the blueprint for the entire application.",
			"reasoning": "This task is crucial for establishing the system's architectural contracts. While not algorithmically complex, it requires significant design foresight to create robust, future-proof interfaces. The 5 subtasks provide a structured approach, including the vital steps of creating mocks and documentation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Unified Platform Extensibility Framework",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The existing 5 subtasks provide an excellent, phased approach to building this complex framework. No further expansion is needed. The focus should be on robustly testing the dynamic loading and hot-reloading features, as these are critical and error-prone.",
			"reasoning": "This task implements the project's core innovation and involves complex concepts like dynamic module loading, a factory supporting multiple strategies, and a hot-reloading registry. The high complexity score reflects the significant architectural and implementation challenges. The 5 subtasks break this down into manageable, sequential pieces."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Child Process Scraping Engine and IPC Communication",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The 5 subtasks provide a logical flow for implementing the IPC and scraping engine. No further expansion is needed. Emphasis should be placed on subtask 5, ensuring that error propagation and resource cleanup (e.g., killing the Puppeteer process on `STOP` or crash) are handled flawlessly.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the asynchronous nature of inter-process communication (IPC) and the management of a resource-intensive tool like Puppeteer. Ensuring robust error handling, state management, and resource cleanup across process boundaries is a significant challenge. The 5 subtasks correctly break down the problem."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Adapters for Phase 1 Platforms",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The 5 subtasks effectively structure the implementation and validation of the initial adapters. No further expansion is needed. It is recommended to budget extra time for subtask 2 (Yelp.com), as it is notoriously difficult to scrape and may require more advanced techniques.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity of this task lies not in the code's architecture but in the investigative, trial-and-error nature of web scraping. Each of the three platforms presents unique challenges (e.g., dynamic content, anti-scraping measures) that require careful analysis. The 5 subtasks correctly structure the work by platform, followed by crucial refactoring and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate with Scheduler, Cookie, and Browser Management Modules",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The 5 subtasks provide a clear plan for integrating with each external module. The focus for subtask 5 should be on testing failure paths: what happens if the cookie module throws an error, or the browser manager fails to provide a browser? The system must fail gracefully.",
			"reasoning": "This is a classic integration task. The complexity is moderate, as it relies on understanding and correctly using existing modules. The main challenge is ensuring proper orchestration, error handling, and resource management across these different system boundaries. The 5 subtasks logically isolate each integration point."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Develop UI for Task and Platform Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The 5 subtasks outline the key UI features. For more detailed planning, consider breaking down subtask 5 ('Implement Visual Editor') further into 'Basic Form Layout', 'Real-time Validation Logic', and 'Raw JSON View Toggle', as this is the most complex component.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex front-end task involving multiple interactive views, real-time data updates, and a sophisticated visual editor for platform configurations. The complexity is high due to the number of distinct UI components and the state management required to connect them to the backend. The 5 subtasks correctly identify the major UI features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Create Platform Development Kit (PDK)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The 5 subtasks provide a solid roadmap for creating the PDK. For subtask 4, consider adding a check to validate the *format* of extracted data (e.g., is the phone number in a consistent format?), which would make the testing framework even more valuable.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is concentrated in the PlatformTestingFramework. Building a reliable, automated testing tool that interacts with live, unpredictable websites is a significant challenge. It requires robust browser automation, asynchronous control flow, and clear reporting. The 5 subtasks provide a well-structured plan."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Adapters for European, German, and UK Platforms",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The 5 subtasks provide a good batching strategy for implementing the 6 adapters. It is recommended to use the Platform Development Kit (PDK) from Task 18 for each adapter and to document the time and effort saved, as this is a key validation for the PDK's success.",
			"reasoning": "This task is similar in nature to Task 15 but larger in scope (6 platforms). The complexity lies in the volume of investigative work required and the potential for new challenges with European sites (e.g., GDPR consent banners). The 5 subtasks effectively group the platforms to manage the workload."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement End-to-End Testing and System Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The 5 subtasks provide a comprehensive plan for the final testing and documentation phase. For subtask 2 (Performance Testing), ensure the test plan explicitly includes checking for UI responsiveness under load and monitoring child process resource usage, not just the main process.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex because it encompasses multiple distinct and demanding activities. Proper performance testing and writing high-quality documentation for both users and developers require specialized skills and significant effort. The 5 subtasks correctly cover all critical aspects of a final quality assurance and release phase."
