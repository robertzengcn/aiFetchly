			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core MCP Server and Automatic Startup",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-defined with 5 subtasks. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to setting up core infrastructure, including a separate build process, inter-process communication (IPC), and child process lifecycle management within an Electron app. These are foundational architectural pieces."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Login State Monitoring and IPC Communication",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-defined with 5 subtasks. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as it requires coordinating state between two separate processes (Electron main and MCP server) via IPC. It involves creating components on both the client and server side and establishing a new communication protocol for state synchronization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop MCP Tools for Search Engine Scraping",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-defined with 5 subtasks. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. While it leverages existing controllers, it requires creating a new, standardized adapter layer including Zod schemas, response formatters, and multiple tool handlers. The process is repeatable but involves several distinct steps for a complete implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop MCP Tools for Yellow Pages Scraping",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the task 'Develop MCP Tools for Yellow Pages Scraping', expand it into 5 subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Defining Zod schemas for `scrape_yellow_pages` and `get_business_details`. 2. Creating a standardized response formatter for `MCPYellowPagesResponse`. 3. Implementing the handler for the `scrape_yellow_pages` tool. 4. Implementing the handler for the `get_business_details` tool. 5. Registering both new tools with the MCP server.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. The task involves adapting existing business logic into the new MCP framework, which requires defining schemas, implementing handler logic, and formatting responses. The pattern is similar to Task 3, but it's still a complete feature implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop MCP Tools for Website Email Extraction",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the task 'Develop MCP Tools for Website Email Extraction', expand it into 5 subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Defining Zod schemas for `extract_emails_from_website` and `validate_email_list`. 2. Implementing response formatters for `MCPEmailExtractionResponse` and `MCPEmailValidationResponse`. 3. Implementing the handler for the `extract_emails_from_website` tool. 4. Implementing the handler for the `validate_email_list` tool. 5. Registering both new tools with the MCP server.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. It requires integrating two distinct pieces of existing functionality (extraction and validation) into the MCP framework. This involves creating schemas, handlers, and response formatters for each tool, making it a multi-part implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop MCP Tools for Email Marketing Task Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the task 'Develop MCP Tools for Email Marketing Task Management', expand it into 6 subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Defining Zod schemas for all four CRUD tool inputs. 2. Implementing the `create_email_task` tool. 3. Implementing the `get_email_task` tool. 4. Implementing the `update_email_task` tool. 5. Implementing the `delete_email_task` tool. 6. Registering all four CRUD tools with the MCP server.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity because it involves implementing a full set of CRUD operations. Each operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) requires its own tool definition, handler, and interaction with the underlying controller and database."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop General Task and Resource Management Tools",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the task 'Develop General Task and Resource Management Tools', expand it into 5 subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Implementing the `get_system_status` tool, including logic to aggregate data from various system monitors. 2. Defining the Zod schema and interface for the generic `create_scraping_task` tool. 3. Implementing the handler for `create_scraping_task` to delegate to specific task creators. 4. Implementing the `get_task_status` tool to poll and return the status of ongoing tasks. 5. Registering all new management tools with the MCP server.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity because it involves creating high-level, generic tools that orchestrate other functionalities. The `create_scraping_task` wrapper is an abstraction layer, and `get_system_status` requires aggregating data from disparate parts of the application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor Existing Controllers for Seamless MCP Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the task 'Refactor Existing Controllers for Seamless MCP Integration', expand it into 6 subtasks. The subtasks should be: 1. Design and document the standard `handleMCPRequest` adapter method interface. 2. Implement the adapter in the `SearchEngineController` and refactor MCP tool calls to use it. 3. Implement the adapter in the `YellowPagesController`. 4. Implement the adapter in the `EmailExtractionController`. 5. Implement the adapter in the `EmailMarketingController`. 6. Write or update unit tests for all new adapter methods to ensure they correctly invoke business logic.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to its cross-cutting nature. Refactoring multiple core controllers requires careful design of a common adapter pattern to ensure consistency and avoid breaking existing application logic. The risk and scope are high."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Robust Error Handling and Server Recovery",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the task 'Implement Robust Error Handling and Server Recovery', expand it into 5 subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Defining and implementing the standardized JSON error response formats, including `LoginStateError`. 2. Modifying the core MCP server to catch specific errors and return these standardized responses. 3. Enhancing the `MCPIntegration` class to monitor the child process's 'exit' event. 4. Implementing the server auto-restart logic within `MCPIntegration`, including a configurable delay and retry limit. 5. Adding retry logic to the initial server startup sequence to handle transient launch failures.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. It combines application-level error standardization with system-level process management (automatic server restart). Implementing a reliable recovery mechanism for a child process is a significant engineering challenge."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize Security, Performance, and Compliance Measures",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the task 'Finalize Security, Performance, and Compliance Measures', expand it into 7 subtasks. The subtasks should be: 1. Implement a generic rate-limiting mechanism that can be applied to MCP tools. 2. Design the database schema and create the model for the `MCPRequestLog` table. 3. Implement audit logging middleware in the MCP server to log all tool invocations. 4. Implement a `robots.txt` parser and integrate checks into all web scraping tools. 5. Review and update email marketing tools to ensure regulatory compliance. 6. Define and execute load tests to validate performance against targets. 7. Perform a security review of the entire MCP implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity. This is a large, cross-cutting task that encompasses multiple distinct and complex domains: performance (load testing), security (rate limiting, review), database changes (auditing), and legal/ethical compliance (robots.txt, email regulations)."
